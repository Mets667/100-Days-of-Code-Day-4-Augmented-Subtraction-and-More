Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction

Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.

let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a = a - 6;
b = b - 15;
c = c - 1;

Pretty straightforward.

a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;

Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication

The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.

let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a = a * 5;
b = 3 * b;
c = c * 10;

Again, all good!

a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;

Compound Assignment With Augmented Division

The /= operator divides a variable by another number.

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.

let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a = a / 12;
b = b / 4;
c = c / 11;

Same as last time:

a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;
